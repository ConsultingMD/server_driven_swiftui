# Server Driven with SwiftUI

## Implementation 

Several json exampled are under `Resources/`
The implemented types are under `Sources` prefixed with _SD_. `ViewSD` is a flexible type that can instantiate any view given its `__typename`. 
Go to the source file to see which keys & values are required and supported.

Open the playground and run the main file to see the live view. Change the json name or update the json file to update the view.
